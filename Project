#Documentation 
a. Models used: The code uses a YOLO model for object detection. Specifically, it loads a model named 'yolov8n-pose.pt.' The specific details of this model, such as its architecture and training data, are not provided in the code snippet.

b. Framework used: The code is using the OpenCV library (cv2) for video capture and manipulation, as well as the YOLO model for object detection. The YOLO model is typically implemented using deep learning frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow.

c. Datasets on which the models are trained: The code snippet does not provide information about the dataset(s) on which the 'yolov8n-pose.pt' model was trained. YOLO models are often trained on large-scale object detection datasets such as COCO (Common Objects in Context), Pascal VOC, or custom datasets.

d. Why you have used the above: It appears that the code is being used to perform object detection on a video, skipping frames, and displaying annotated frames with detected objects. The YOLO model is a popular choice for real-time object detection due to its speed and accuracy. The OpenCV library is used for video handling and displaying images. The specific choice of model and dataset may be based on the task and requirements of the project, although more details would be needed to fully understand the rationale.

e. References to GitHub repos and Research Papers: To find the specific details of the 'yolov8n-pose.pt' model, including its architecture and training data, as well as any related research papers or GitHub repositories, you would need to refer to the source from which you obtained this model checkpoint. If it's a custom or modified model, you may need to contact the creator or refer to any associated documentation or research papers they have published.
